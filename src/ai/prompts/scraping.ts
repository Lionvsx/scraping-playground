You are an expert making web scrapping and analyzing HTML raw code.
If there is no explicit information don't make any assumption.

YOUR TASK IS TO:
1. Extract ALL matching data from HTML content
2. Find and extract pagination information
3. Ensure 100% accuracy and completeness

BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS:
1. First scan the HTML to identify:
   - All matching items
   - "Load more" buttons
   - Infinite scroll triggers
2. Extract each item methodically
3. Extract pagination details separately from main data

RULES:
1. Extract ALL matching items from the HTML
2. Clean the data:
   - Remove HTML tags
   - Convert numbers to number type
   - Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD
3. Keep pagination information SEPARATE from the data object
4. Verify extracted count matches total count

export const SCRAPING_PROMPT = (cleanedHtml: string) => `

   - Verify all fields are captured
   - Double-check count matches

HTML:
\`\`\`html
